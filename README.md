# EasyNLP [中文介绍](https://github.com/alibaba/EasyNLP/blob/master/README.cn.md)
  
EasyNLP is an easy-to-use NLP development and application toolkit in PyTorch, first released inside Alibaba in 2021. It is built with scalable distributed training strategies and supports a comprehensive suite of NLP algorithms for various NLP applications. EasyNLP integrates knowledge distillation and few-shot learning for landing large pre-trained models, together with various popular multi-modality pre-trained models. It provides a unified framework of model training, inference, and deployment for real-world applications. It has powered more than 10 BUs and more than 20 business scenarios within the Alibaba group. It is seamlessly integrated to [Platform of AI (PAI)](https://www.aliyun.com/product/bigdata/product/learn) products, including PAI-DSW for development, PAI-DLC for cloud-native training, PAI-EAS for serving, and PAI-Designer for zero-code model training.


# Main Features

- **Easy to use and highly customizable:** In addition to providing easy-to-use and concise commands to call cutting-edge models, it also abstracts certain custom modules such as AppZoo and ModelZoo to make it easy to build NLP applications. It is equipped with the PAI PyTorch distributed training framework TorchAccelerator to speed up distributed training.
- **Compatible with open-source libraries:** EasyNLP has APIs to support the training of models from Huggingface/Transformers with the PAI distributed framework. It also supports the pre-trained models in [EasyTransfer](https://github.com/alibaba/EasyTransfer) ModelZoo.
- **Knowledge-injected pre-training:** The PAI team has a lot of research on knowledge-injected pre-training, and builds a knowledge-injected model that wins first place in the CCF knowledge pre-training competition. EasyNLP integrates these cutting-edge knowledge pre-trained models, including DKPLM and KGBERT.
- **Landing large pre-trained models:** EasyNLP provides few-shot learning capabilities, allowing users to finetune large models with only a few samples to achieve good results. At the same time, it provides knowledge distillation functions to help quickly distill large models to a small and efficient model to facilitate online deployment.
- **Multi-modality pre-trained models:** EasyNLP is not about NLP only. It also supports various popular multi-modality pre-trained models to support vision-language tasks that require visual knowledge. For example, it is equipped with CLIP-style models for text-image matching and DALLE-style models for text-to-image generation.

# Installation

You can either install it from pip

```bash
$ pip install pai-easynlp (may be out-of-date)
```

or setup from the source：

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/alibaba/EasyNLP.git
$ cd EasyNLP
$ python setup.py install
```

This repo is tested on Python 3.6, PyTorch >= 1.8.

# Quick Start

Now let's show how to use just a few lines of code to build a text classification model based on BERT.

You can also load a dataset based on dataset name and starts to train.
```python
from easynlp.core import Trainer
from easynlp.appzoo import GeneralDataset, SequenceClassification, load_dataset
from easynlp.utils import initialize_easynlp

args = initialize_easynlp()

row_data = load_dataset('glue', 'qnli')["train"]
train_dataset = GeneralDataset(row_data, args.pretrained_model_name_or_path, args.sequence_length)

model = SequenceClassification(pretrained_model_name_or_path=args.pretrained_model_name_or_path)
Trainer(model=model,  train_dataset=train_dataset).train()
```
For more datasets, please check it out in [DataHub](https://github.com/alibaba/EasyNLP/tree/master/datahub).

Alternatively, you can use the classification dataset api to support new classification datasets.
```python
from easynlp.core import Trainer
from easynlp.appzoo import ClassificationDataset, SequenceClassification
from easynlp.utils import initialize_easynlp

args = initialize_easynlp()

train_dataset = ClassificationDataset(
    pretrained_model_name_or_path=args.pretrained_model_name_or_path,
    data_file=args.tables,
    max_seq_length=args.sequence_length,
    input_schema=args.input_schema,
    first_sequence=args.first_sequence,
    label_name=args.label_name,
    label_enumerate_values=args.label_enumerate_values,
    is_training=True)

model = SequenceClassification(pretrained_model_name_or_path=args.pretrained_model_name_or_path)
Trainer(model=model, train_dataset=train_dataset).train()
```

Then you can run the code:

```bash
python main.py \
  --mode train \
  --tables=train_toy.tsv \
  --input_schema=label:str:1,sid1:str:1,sid2:str:1,sent1:str:1,sent2:str:1 \
  --first_sequence=sent1 \
  --label_name=label \
  --label_enumerate_values=0,1 \
  --checkpoint_dir=./tmp/ \
  --epoch_num=1  \
  --app_name=text_classify \
  --user_defined_parameters='pretrain_model_name_or_path=bert-tiny-uncased'
```

The complete example can be found [here](https://github.com/alibaba/EasyNLP/blob/master/examples/appzoo_tutorials/sequence_classification/bert_classify/run_train_eval_predict_user_defined_local.sh).

You can also use AppZoo Command Line Tools to quickly train an App model. Take text classification on SST-2 dataset as an example. First you can download the [train.tsv](http://atp-modelzoo-sh.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/release/tutorials/classification/train.tsv), and [dev.tsv](http://atp-modelzoo-sh.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/release/tutorials/classification/dev.tsv), then start training:

```bash
$ easynlp \
   --mode=train \
   --worker_gpu=1 \
   --tables=train.tsv,dev.tsv \
   --input_schema=label:str:1,sid1:str:1,sid2:str:1,sent1:str:1,sent2:str:1 \
   --first_sequence=sent1 \
   --label_name=label \
   --label_enumerate_values=0,1 \
   --checkpoint_dir=./classification_model \
   --epoch_num=1  \
   --sequence_length=128 \
   --app_name=text_classify \
   --user_defined_parameters='pretrain_model_name_or_path=bert-small-uncased'
```

And then predict:

```bash
$ easynlp \
  --mode=predict \
  --tables=dev.tsv \
  --outputs=dev.pred.tsv \
  --input_schema=label:str:1,sid1:str:1,sid2:str:1,sent1:str:1,sent2:str:1 \
  --output_schema=predictions,probabilities,logits,output \
  --append_cols=label \
  --first_sequence=sent1 \
  --checkpoint_path=./classification_model \
  --app_name=text_classify
```
