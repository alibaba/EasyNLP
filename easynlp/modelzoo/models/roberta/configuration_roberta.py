    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a :class:`~transformers.RobertaModel` or a
    :class:`~transformers.TFRobertaModel`. It is used to instantiate a RoBERTa model according to the specified
    arguments, defining the model architecture.


    Configuration objects inherit from :class:`~transformers.PretrainedConfig` and can be used to control the model
    outputs. Read the documentation from :class:`~transformers.PretrainedConfig` for more information.

    The :class:`~transformers.RobertaConfig` class directly inherits :class:`~transformers.BertConfig`. It reuses the
    same defaults. Please check the parent class for more information.
